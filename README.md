# Anomaly Detection Toolbox
___________________________

In data mining, [anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection) (also outlier detection) is the identification of data points, items, observations or events that do not conform to the expected pattern of a given group. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.

This Anomaly Detection Toolbox is a Python module for machine learning anomaly detection built on top of [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and other open source python libraries. 

New models will be added into this repository continously
